What is Intraseller?
 Intraseller allows a sales team to share information about products, as well as solutions to unique issues.
 Not every salesperson knows every single product with the same level of depth, especially when hundreds of products get released monthly.

How is this different than the stores	official website that offers information to the customers?
 The degree of knowledge required to help customers cannot be easily put onto a website for the customers to view, since each customer needs the information to be tailored to his level of experience.

- Create custom categories
	- Every category page has a Q&A section
	- Items are added to categories along with a note which describes their role within the larger picture

- Items
	- Item pages allow you to add quick bullet points
	- Every item page has a Q&A section

- Comparisons
	- Intraseller allows you to create comparison pages between any 2 items



More Info
---------

Every item page allows you to see how that item fits into every category it is part of.
It also displays a list of all items that have been compared to it.

Although Intraseller could be used by any company, this initial release had my current company in mind, this is reflected by the web scraper and other cosmetic parts of the application.
